# RustyCraft Retro Arcade
## (No Docker Required)

Dear Gamer,

Thank you for choosing my creation, RustyCraft Retro Arcade (NDR)! This project is the result of relentless searching and countless hours of work to create a browser-based ROM playing solution that stands independent of Docker - a rare find in today's landscape.

### Installation

I've kept the installation process straightforward:

1. Extract this package into a directory on your server or local machine.
2. Create a "games" folder within the root directory of this project. This is where you'll store all your ROMs, organized by their respective cores.
3. As an example, if you're setting up for Game Boy Advance games, make a "gba" subfolder within "games".
4. Place your GBA ROM files into this "gba" folder, as indicated in the example script.

**Most up to date releases:**

And voil√†, you're all set to dive into gaming nostalgia.

### Get in Touch

I am eager to see how you might enhance this project. Elegant CSS for the game selection screen, innovative design improvements, or even broadening the scope of emulated systems - I welcome it all.

### Note

RustyCraft Retro Arcade (NDR) proudly highlights its independence from Docker, streamlining your gaming experience. I've designed these instructions to be simple enough for anyone to follow, aiming to empower even the most novice users to launch their own retro arcade.

Thank you again for using my source. I'm excited to see what you'll bring to the table and how you'll enjoy the games of yesteryear through RustyCraft.

Happy Gaming!

### Credits

None of this would be possible without the incredible foundation laid by the work on emulator.js. A heartfelt thank you to the creator Ethan O'Brien, whose dedication and talent in the field of browser-based emulation have paved the way for projects like RustyCraft Retro Arcade.

Due to all the legal-mumbo-jumbo, ROMS were not included, however, if you are working on a project like this, you probably already have your own. Enjoy!!
